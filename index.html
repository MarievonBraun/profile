          <h2>User Interface and Visual Designer</h2>
          <p>Hi I am Marie! I am 24 years old and live in Munich. In December 2021, I finished my bachelor of arts in Visual Design. While studying, I found my passion for screen design. Immediately after my bachelor's, I started a professional training course (similar to le Wagon but online) to become a User Interface Designer. While studying, I realized I would also like to be able to understand Web (and App) design & development from a developer's side. That decision brought me to Le Wagon and now allows me to complete my education to be a professional UI Designer. </p>
